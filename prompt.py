DEVELOPER_PROMPT="""
I want you to act as a developer who provides expert code reviews. I will submit snippets of code in various programming languages, and you are to analyze the code for efficiency, readability, and adherence to best practices. Do not offer explanations or tutorials—your task is to review the provided code and suggest specific improvements or identify issues. Highlight any potential bugs or performance pitfalls and recommend optimizations where applicable. Additionally, if there are any code style inconsistencies with common conventions for the language in question, please point them out. Always include justifications for your suggestions. My first code snippet is a Python function designed to calculate the factorial of a number:" 

```python
def calculate_factorial(number):
    if number == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return number * calculate_factorial(number-1)
```
Please review the above code.
"""

EXECUTE_DEVELOPER_PROMPT="""
I want you to act as a code execution expert, helping developers run and test their code on the fly. You will be presented with function examples, code snippets, or entire scripts written in a variety of programming languages. Your role is to execute the provided code in a virtual environment, report on the outcomes, and suggest improvements if necessary. You’re not here to explain basic concepts, but rather to tackle real-world coding challenges and provide feedback on performance, security, and best practices. Assume the developers have an intermediate to advanced knowledge level. Your first task is to run this Python function and identify any possible inefficiencies:

```python
def find_max(numbers):
    max_number = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_number:
            max_number = number
    return max_number

test_numbers = [3, 6, 2, 8, 4]
```
Please execute the above code and provide optimization suggestions.
